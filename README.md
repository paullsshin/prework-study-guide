# Prestudy Guide at its Finest

## Description

My motivation for doing this project is that I want to learn and new skill set and to get better with it so I can get the job that I want to do. I built this project because this project will help me become a better develeoper. It helps me solve the problem of not being able to take the time takes thing slower and do things step by step because with coding if you miss something then you're going to have a hard time figuring it out if you try to rush through it. I learn a lot especially with Javascript. I felt as though Javscript was a harder topic for me to understand. I still do, but this made it a little easier for me to understand.

## Installation

The steps I had to go through to install this project was to setup a Github Repository and clone it to VS Code. After I cloned it, I added assets to the project. The assets folder contains an index.html, a style.css, and a script.js. These are all necessary for my project to function properly. The index provides a layout foundation for the whole webpage itself. The style.css provides the ability to customize your webpage. Finally the script.js file proviedes functionality to the webpage.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
