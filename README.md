# Prestudy Guide at its Finest üéÜ

## Description üñäÔ∏è

My motivation for doing this project is that I want to learn and new skill set and to get better with it so I can get the job that I want to do. I built this project because this project will help me become a better develeoper. It helps me solve the problem of not being able to take the time takes thing slower and do things step by step because with coding if you miss something then you're going to have a hard time figuring it out if you try to rush through it. I learn a lot especially with Javascript. I felt as though Javscript was a harder topic for me to understand. I still do, but this made it a little easier for me to understand.

## Installation üîß

The steps I had to go through to install this project was to setup a Github Repository and clone it to VS Code. After I cloned it, I added assets to the project. The assets folder contains an index.html, a style.css, and a script.js. These are all necessary for my project to function properly. The index provides a layout foundation for the whole webpage itself. The style.css provides the ability to customize your webpage. Finally the script.js file proviedes functionality to the webpage.


## Usage üíª

The functionality of the page is simple and as easy as 1,2,3! All you need to do is open the webpage and right click your mouse button and from the available options select inspect. After you select inspect, move your mouse so it hovers over "Console" near the bottom half of your screen, After you click on conosle, you should see some words at the bottom of the page that suggests what topic we should study! The function is random as well so whenevr you reload the page the words in the console will change to a different topic! Use the following images as a reference in case you get lost.
